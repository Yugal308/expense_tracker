### What is TRACK MY EXPENSES?

TRACK MY EXPENSES is a web app for keeping track on our day to day transactions. The app is divided into 2 parts Income and Expense.
Voice based adding of Income or Expense is also added in it using "Speechly", along with "Local Storage" concept is used in it for saving user's activity directly on the browser itself.

### How it works?

Open the website
User can choose the desired category of Income and Expense along with also choosing accurate date and amount for that Income or Expense, as soon as user clicks on create button beautiful colored pie chart is generated displaying our Income or Expense.
User can also add Income/Expense through Voice, due to support of speechly
User's activity is saved on browser itself which means whatever data of Income/Expense is imported by user, won't be vanished even after closing the browser beacuse of local storage.
